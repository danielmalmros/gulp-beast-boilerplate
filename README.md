Frontend Gulp Boilerplate
==========================

Personalized Frontend workflow from Harvest Boilerplate by Daniel Malmros.

You'll need to have Gulp installed. If you already have Gulp installed, you can skip the following line. It is as simple as running:
* `npm install -g gulp`

* Run `npm-install.cmd` to install dev dependencies. Use sudo if needed.

During development mode, run the default task so you'll have watchers and browser sync.
* Run `gulp` to set fire on this beast!

When project is ready to deploy, simply do the following:
* Run `gulp deploy`
* All of the files you need will be in /dist with your images optimized, css compressed and js compressed!
